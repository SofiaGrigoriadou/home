I am a final year Biomedical Sciences undergraduate student, currently performing a 12-month traineeship at University of Messina, funded by Erasmus+ grants.

Under the guidance of Prof. Tsamesidis Ioannis, I completed my undergraduate thesis titled "**Effects of *Achillea millefolium* on the physiology of red blood cells and platelets**". My research enabled me to gain significant experience in handling and analyzing blood samples, and the subsequent results.

I am also interested in bringing science to the everyday person, which was the inspiration behing "The Biomedicals", a blog (link) and social media channels (link) aiming to make biology accessible - to everyone.
