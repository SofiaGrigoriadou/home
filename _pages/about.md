⚲ Dept. of Biomedical Sciences, International Hellenic University, Greece | ⚲ Dept. of Chemical, Biological, Pharmaceutical and Environmental Sciences, University of Messina, Italy

I am a final year Biomedical Sciences undergraduate student, currently performing a 12-month traineeship at University of Messina, funded by Erasmus+ grants.

Under the guidance of Prof. Tsamesidis Ioannis, I completed my undergraduate thesis titled "**Effects of *Achillea millefolium* on the physiology of red blood cells and platelets**". My research enabled me to gain significant experience in handling and analyzing blood samples, and the subsequent results.

I am also interested in bringing science to the everyday person, which was the inspiration behing "The Biomedicals", a blog (link) and social media channels (link) aiming to make biology accessible - to everyone.

## Selected Experience


# Research Experience Example

My research experience comes from the experiments I run and the protocols I build as part of my udergraduate thesis and my traineeship.

I have experience in wet lab techniques in the field of haematology; namely, preparation of blood samples, performing hemocompatibility assays and osmotic fragility tests, preparation and observation of microscope slides, and testing blood coagulation time. 

Moreover, I presented my findings (link) at the 36th Annual Hellenic Haematology Congress, organized by the Hellenic Society of Haematology.


# Teaching Experience Example

I run "The Biomedicals", a blog and social media channels aimed to help bridge the gap between researchers and the general public.

Additionally, I provide private tutoring to high-school students on the subjects of Biology, Haematology, and Immunology.
